1) MySql queries :

	create table Video (ID int not null auto_increment, NAME varchar(50), DESCRIPTION varchar(100), ACTIVE varchar (10), PRIMARY KEY(ID));

	create table VideoList (D_ID int not null auto_increment Primary Key, 
	Name varchar (50), Link varchar(100), U_ID int not null , CONSTRAINT fk_td FOREIGN KEY(U_ID) REFERENCES Video(ID));

	other queries are also used in main program


2) These two tables will satisfy the one to many condition.

3) CRUD operation were carried out in nodejs by exposing the express.js APIs.
	 POST : To insert datas in database 
	 GET : to get data, either all or by using /:id to get specific row
	 DELETE : to delete datas either all or specific row by /:id
	 PUT : updating datas in database
  
   Futher more, I only creted a form to insert values. I didn't create any UI for GET, DELETE, or POST. I used Postman to check my APIs.
